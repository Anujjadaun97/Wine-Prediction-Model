**Wine Quality Prediction**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook [Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/Anujjadaun97/Wine-Prediction-Model/blob/main/Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb) that demonstrates a machine learning project aimed at predicting wine quality.

**Project Overview**
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow to build and evaluate a model for wine quality prediction.

**Key Steps**
Data Collection: Gathers a labeled dataset suitable for supervised learning.

Data Analysis: Explores the dataset to understand its characteristics and relationships.

Data Pre-processing: Prepares the raw data for model training, which may include cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.

Train-Test Split: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Random Forest Model: Implements a Random Forest Classifier for predicting wine quality.

Prediction: Utilizes the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Technologies and Libraries**
The project uses the following Python libraries:

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

Seaborn: A data visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for:

model_selection: For splitting data into training and testing sets.

ensemble.RandomForestClassifier: For the Random Forest classification algorithm.

metrics.accuracy_score: For evaluating the accuracy of the model.

**Dataset**
The project utilizes the [winequality-red.csv](https://github.com/Anujjadaun97/Wine-Prediction-Model/blob/main/winequality-red.csv) dataset, which contains various physicochemical properties of red wines and their corresponding quality ratings.
